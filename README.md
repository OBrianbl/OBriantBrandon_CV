#### DATA SCIENCE PROJECTS 

##### Spring 2017-Present 

* Pulled securities data from Yahoo Finance for Apple Inc. (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), Intel (INTL), and Tesla Inc. (TSLA). Performed 1000 different weight combinations to produce a Markowitz optimized portfolio and visualized the Markowitz Efficient Frontier. Then the Sharpe Ratio was constructed to identify two portfolios on the efficient frontier. One with the minimum risk with highest return and the other highest return with acceptable risk. Python (Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib) 

* Compared classification methods, logistic regression, Naive Bayes, and support vector machine using a cross-validation design. The average AUROC was used to assess the performance of the models ability to predict customers that will participate in term deposits. Python (SciKit-Learn, Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib) 

* Created a 10-KFold cross-validation design, using root mean-squared error (RMSE), to compare regression methods (linear, ridge, lasso, and elastic net) for assessing the market value of residential real estate. Python (SciKit-Learn, Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Os, and Seaborn) 

* Conducted exploratory data analysis of software preferences for course offerings in the new data science program design at Northwestern University.  Python courses were most preferred at 31.11%. Python (Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn) 

* Developed and tested neural networks, within a benchmark experiment, for classification of handwritten characters from the MNIST data set, consisting of 70,000 observations. Python ( SciKit-Learn) 

* Used PCA to generate principal components representing 95% of the variability in 784 explanatory variables. Random forest classifiers were constructed with and without principal components to classify handwritten digits. Performance of the models were assessed using an F1-score. Python (SciKit-Learn) 

* PostgreSQL and Python were used generate sales reports based on previous month's sales transactions. 

* To assist business analyst working on a model for customer lifetime value analysis, PostgreSQL and Python were used to extract the relevant data and presented to the analyst with commadelimited .txt file for use. 

* Used R to perform exploratory data analysis methods to identify characteristic differences between abalone classes. Performed variance and linear regression analysis to construct and evaluate binary decision rules for practical harvesting level of abalones. 

### PERSONAL WEB PORTFOLIO 

* HTML, CSS, and JavaScript were used to build personal web portfolio that is hosted through GitHub-Git Pages. 

### PACIFIC LUTHERAN UNIVERSITY, SENIOR CAPSTONE 2016 

* Fuzzy Set Theory--Application in Forecasting: Researched Fuzzy Logic/Set theory and formulated a detailed comparative analysis to ‘crisp’ logic.
